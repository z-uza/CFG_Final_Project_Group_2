# Full Stack Pathway Group 2 project: 'Fun 4 All'
A Web App for users to use to access information about Theme Park accessibility and Theme Park Ride Wait times.

## About the project

This App allows users to plan ahead for a potential visit to a Theme Park and learn about support services and accessibility facilities available at selected Theme Parks.  Users can access the latest information on current wait times on all rides at the selected Theme Parks.  Knowing the wait times for rides can support user to plan their day accordingly whilst at the park. The App has been designed to be used by either individuals with disabilities and additional needs and/or accompanying carers and family members who are planning a visit. 

### Project Document
For a deep dive into the background and strategy behind the App, take a look at the Project Document within the Project Folder.

### Software used
- We used Node,js as a javascript runtime environment
- We built the App in React using JSX, HTML, CSS and Javascript languages.
- We used a range of React libraries: 
- We used Figma to create a wireframe to design our User Interface and plan our User Experience https://www.figma.com/
- We used an external API https://queue-times.com/ 
- We used Git and Github for version control to collaborate as a team of 6 developers.

### Future updates
For future releases, we will add the following new features:
- User Login and password authentication.
- Users can be signposted directly to Access Support Teams at Theme Parks.
- Users can acccess directions from their location to Theme Park using Google Maps
- Users can add reviews of Theme Park Accessibility Facilities for other users.
- Users can add reviews of Theme Park Rides with disability in mind for other users.
- Options for users to undo / edit favourites.

## How to install and run the project
1.	Clone the CFG_Final_Project_Group_2 repository to your local machine using the url [https://github.com/z-uza/CFG_Final_Project_Group_2 ](https://github.com/z-uza/CFG_Final_Project_Group_2)
2.	Open the project folder 'group app' in Visual Studio Code
3.	From your command terminal, locate the pathway to the project folder, once inside 'group-app' install React requirements by running node.js using these command prompts: **npm install** followed by **npm start**
4.	In your web browser locate the tab with the React logo and check that page is running from a local host server which should displayed in the web app address bar, the contents of the Home page of the Web App 'Fun 4 All' should be displayed
5. The Web App can be navigated by using the nav bar and buttons on the home page.
6. The code files for the App can be accessed via the project folder 'group-app.'

## How to use the project
The App has the following functionality:
- Users can navigate their way through the Web App via a Nav bar
- Users can view all Theme Park Accessibility Information via a drop down menu.
- Users can view all rides available at any selected Theme Park via a drop down menu.
- Users can find out the current wait times for any ride they select in any selected Theme Park.
- Users can save their favourite rides to a favourites page for their convenience.
- Users can make contact with the App creators via links to GitHub on About Page

### Summary of design principles and testing

The App was designed for ease of use and to provide the user with simple intuitive user friendly interface. Users are able to navigate through the web app via the nav bar buttons which displays three pages: Home, About, Favourites. From the Home page there is a button to take the user to a Theme Park Page and also from the Home page there is a button to take the user to the Theme Park Accessibility Page, so there are five pages in total.
Testing has allowed us to improve the user experience. For example, we have included test files within the 'group-app' folder to test various components, such as testing accessibility button name is correctly displayed. 

## Credits
### Full Stack Pathway Group 2 members
This team project is a collaboration between six developers:
**[Majella O'Mahony](https://github.com/MadgeMom)**
Currently on the Full Stack Pathway of a Nano Degree with Code First Girls.  I have a teaching background in Education and I Mentor and coach autistic adults and adults with ADHD. What inspired me to learn computer languages...? When I was a teacher I discovered that creating coding projects were the highlight of my week and also my students.  I want to turn a fun hobby into a full-time job!

Previous CFG Projects:
- Designed and created an interactive web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Created an interactive web application with a suite of interactive productivity tools using HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Create a console app in Python to interact with an API to obtain Data and transform Data for impact
- Designed and built a relational database, with complex queries, in-built functions, joins, stored procedures and to handle specific complex Data requirements
- created an interactive App using HTTP requests and internal API to support fictional business
  
This project has given us the oportunity to develop and demonstrate skills and knowledge of programming languages: HTML, CSS, javascript and JSX, experience of building components in React, Hook states, testing theory and application, gain experience with javascript runtime environment Node.js, gain experience of using agile methodologies within a team, effective team comunication and gain confidence in using Version Control Systems, such as Git(using terminal commands) and GitHub.
