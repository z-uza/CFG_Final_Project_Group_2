Theme Park Wait Times 🏰🎡🎠🎢🎪
Part 1 -
1. Come up with a project idea you will all like to work on. 

As a group we have decided to create a centralised hub catering primarily to those with accessibility needs to help enhance their theme-park experience. 

2. Submit a document that contains details of your project such as: 
o What is the concept/ what are you building? Think exactly about what needs to be built. 

Our project aims to create a web application that improves the customer experience at theme parks. There are two main avenues we aim to take to meet this goal. 
●	Firstly, by providing additional information about various accessibility features available and other facilities at selected theme parks. 
●	Secondly, by accessing data from an API that informs users about the likely wait time for specific rides at the selected theme park. This is critical for those with accessibility needs.

 3. Who will this help? Who’s your target audience? 

●	Those with disabilities/accessibility needs - to understand where there’s facilities in place to cater to them and make their visit as smooth as possible
○	Currently, this information is fragmented across multiple theme-park applications and websites - our project aims to create a centralised location for this info to be easily accessed
○	Understanding wait times is critical for those with additional needs 

●	Thrill-seekers - want to maximise time spent on rides and not waiting so the application can help them plan their visit efficiently
●	Families with young children - to help plan their day and work around various services available inc. those for young kids 

4. How will you be working? What tools will help with that? 

Technologies:
●	UX/UI - Figma 
●	Frontend -  React, CSS 
●	Backend - ExpressJS; NodeJS (to confirm)
●	Database - We will store accessibility info using mySQL, making API calls to this to retrieve the theme-park relevant data.
●	API - https://queue-times.com/pages/api (free to use - just need to give credit on the application somewhere) 

Work style- agile? waterfall?

5. How are you going to organise the workload? Who does what and when?

Please give us feedback on best way to organise this

6. What are the main features of your project?

Maximising Enjoyment
●	Wait times per ride - user can filter by theme park and/or ride 

Efficient Planning 
●	Users can also check if the ride is open or not - especially if they plan to visit a park for a specific ride  - can be used as a reassurance to avoid disappointment
●	The application should estimate how long a customer would need to go on all the rides in one day (based on wait times for all planned selected rides and opening/closing times)
●	Allow users to favourite their favourite theme parks and/or rides - especially useful for those thrill seekers who re-visit their favourite parks and want to minimise wait times
●	Promoting inclusion -Ensuring all can access the rides by providing information in one place to help with planning

Extended functionalities (TBC)
●	Push notifications to users about significant changes in wait times or ride closures - based on their favourite rides
